# USTC MIS System Score Export Script

## From the Author
This is a simple script written in Python.
It's unpacked, poorly organised, merely tested
but may still work.
Feel free to change the code.

I want to expand the function of this script including adding a graphic interface,
complement a GPA calculator for differnet standards.
But I may not have the time.
Therefore, fork and pull request are welcome.

## Requirements ( It's just my working environment )
python 3.6.2
urllib 1.22
pyquery 1.4.0
pandas 0.20.3
